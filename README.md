## Overview

### The Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to build a responsive product preview card component. Users should be able to:

- View the layout optimized for different screen sizes (desktop & mobile)
- See hover and focus effects on interactive elements

## Development Process

### Technologies Used

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- Visual Studio Code as the code editor

### Key Takeaways

One of the key concepts I practiced in this project was responsive images. Below is an example of how I handled image responsiveness using `srcset` and `sizes`:

```html
<img
  srcset="
    images/image-product-desktop.jpg 600w,
    images/image-product-mobile.jpg  686w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 686px, 300px"
  src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
  alt="A bottle of perfume surrounded by foliage"
/>
```

This ensures the appropriate image loads based on the user's screen width.
